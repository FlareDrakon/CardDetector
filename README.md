# CardDetector
this project demonstrate how to get card type by color
Optimal way is not a Goal for this project its demostration of how to replace machine learning by self implementation and issues of that


Later some bad guys try to bring to me test task with conditions:
1. no library usage (of course include machine learning mechanism)
2. near 100 code lines
3. avoid to  use alghoritms for delect alfanumeric from picture - use your own one.
4. use color based detection instead byte one because small defferences is present.



After several days of research I write this project but guys does not say anything for it.
I think it's bad practice when test task have no feedback.
So if anyone try to test you with task like this get it here.
